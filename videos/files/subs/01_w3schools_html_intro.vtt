00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.320
Hello! So you want
to learn how to make websites.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.000
In that case you need to learn HTML!

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.600
So let's start at the very beginning.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.280
What exactly is HTML?

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.480
And why do I need it?

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.680
Let's break it down from the basics,
and build our way up.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.240
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.080
It uses markup to describe
the structure of web pages.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.840
The structure is built up by elements,
and they are represented by tags!

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.400
Tags label pieces of content
such as "heading"

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.920
"paragraph" "table" and so on.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.800
These tags aren't shown on the page,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.880
but are used to display content
in different ways.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.600
That's a lot to digest!

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.480
So let's go into it.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.040
First let's try it together.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.800
Don't worry about understanding,
it'll all click as we work through it.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.520
We start by declaring
that this is an HTML document.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.200
The &lt;html&gt; is the root
element of any HTML page.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.400
The &lt;head&gt; contains meta information
about the document.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.200
The &lt;title&gt; element specifies
a title for the document.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.800
The &lt;body&gt; contains
the visible page content.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.280
Finally, the &lt;h1&gt; defines a large heading,
while &lt;p&gt; defines a paragraph.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.480
With everything set in the order, let's

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.600
go into the explanation of how tags work.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.520
Tags typically come in pairs.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.040
A start tag, and the end tag.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.520
The end tag is written
just like the start tag,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.280
but with a forward slash inserted
before the tag name.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.720
Here we've got the tag name
and the forward slash tag name.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.080
And the contents of the element
in between them.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.840
So if this was a paragraph, we'd use
&lt;p&gt; --- &lt;/p&gt; and some text in the middle.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.320
Let's play a game.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.560
See if we can correctly match start,
and end tags, together.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.920
So what turns HTML code and elements
into a viewable website?

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.480
Well, that's where web browsers come in.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.600
The purpose of a web browser, be
it Chrome, Firefox, Edge,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.600
or Safari, is to read HTML documents
and display them.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.000
But, the browser
does not display the HTML code.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.880
Instead, it uses it, to determine
how to display the document.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.720
Let's see what kind of building blocks
are hidden behind this webpage.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.160
This is a visualization
of an HTML page structure.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.960
You can see the HTML,
the head, with the page title

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.520
below that, and then the body under that.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.360
And that's the basics.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.120
Let's delve into this further,
but for now, take a break.
